# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for a personal portfolio site showcasing multidisciplinary creative work across photography, cinematography, 3D design & animation, and development.

## Summary

The website features an interactive, card-based interface that highlights key project categories with links to external portfolios and project databases. It’s built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by Bootstrap Icons for a clean and responsive user experience.

Additionally, the repository includes an extra standalone HTML page `playing-cards.html` created as a design example and reference.
The project was updated, and there are now two versions of this portfolio: the `index-old.html`, which I don't want to delete because that was my initial idea and I still like it, and the currently used `index.html`, which is the newly updated version, and I'm satisfied with it.
